# Image-Processing-using-YOLO-by-darknet

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a method / way to do object detection. It is the algorithm /strategy behind how the code is going to detect objects in the image.

The official implementation of this idea is available through DarkNet (neural net implementation from the ground up in 'C' from the author). It is available on github for people to use.

Earlier detection frameworks, looked at different parts of the image multiple times at different scales and repurposed image classification technique to detect objects. This approach is slow and inefficient.

YOLO takes entirely different approach. It looks at the entire image only once and goes through the network once and detects objects. Hence the name. It is very fast. Thatâ€™s the reason it has got so popular.
